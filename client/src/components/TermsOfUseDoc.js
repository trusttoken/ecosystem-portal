<h1 style={{textAlign: "center"}}>Terms of Use</h1>
<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>Last modified: Jun 1, 2020</p>
<p>Welcome to the TrustToken Purchaser Portal! Please read these Terms of Use and our <Link to="/privacy-policy"> Privacy Policy </Link> (collectively the “Terms”) carefully, as you agree that you consent to these Terms by your use of this website and the services, as described further below.</p>
<h2>Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h2>
<p>These terms of use are entered into by and between you and TrustToken, Inc. (“Company,” “TrustToken,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), and they govern your access to and use of TrustToken’s purchaser portal (<a href="https://portal.trusttoken.com">portal.trusttoken.com</a>) (the “Portal”), including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through the Portal, whether as a guest or a registered user.</p>
<p>Please read the Terms carefully before you use the Portal. By using the Portal, or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Portal or any TrustToken services.</p>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>The Portal is only intended for adults eighteen (18) years of age and older. You are not allowed to use the Portal or provide information on it if you are under eighteen (18) years of age. The Portal is limited to users who have previously met the Company’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing customer due diligence requirements.</p>
<h2>Changes to the Terms of Use and Portal</h2>
<p>We will likely change and update these Terms from time to time, and these changes are effective as soon as we post them on the Portal. If you continue to use the Portal following the posting of any revised Terms, you are accepting and agreeing to the changes.</p>
<p>We may also update the content on the Portal as we see fit, but do not guarantee that any content is necessarily complete or up-to-date.</p>
<h2>No Class Proceedings</h2>
<p>You and we agree that any party hereto may bring claims against the other on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless the parties agree otherwise, any adjudicator of any claim—whether judicial or otherwise—may not consolidate or join more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Any adjudicator of any claim may award relief, including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users of the Portal or of any Services..</p>
<h2>Accessing the Portal</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to amend the Portal, and any service or material we provide on the Portal, in our sole discretion without notice. This includes, but is not limited to, replacing the existing TrustToken smart contracts with new smart contracts or moving TrustTokens to a new blockchain. In the event that a TrustToken smart contract is replaced or moved to a new blockchain, balances will be transferred and the old TrustTokens may be invalid.</p>
<p>Should a blockchain on which TrustTokens are on forks, we reserve the right to select the new fork based on factors that include, but are not limited to, community adoption and long-term viability. In the event of a fork, all TrustTokens on the non-chosen fork will not be valid for any purpose. The Company defines a blockchain fork as a protocol upgrade that breaks backward compatibility. The Company shall have sole and absolute discretion in defining a blockchain fork.</p>
<p>In order to cause TrustTokens to be unlocked by the Company, you must be a verified customer of the Company. You must have previously passed our KYC/AML validation requirements. It is a condition of your use of the Portal that information you previously provided to the Company was correct, current, and complete.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to deny access to the Portal to anyone or cancel an account for any or no reason, including but not limited to violations of these Terms, applicable laws and regulations, or engaging in any Prohibited Uses as outlined below, and at any time, at our sole discretion. If we terminate your account for any reason, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions.</p>
<h2>Account Security</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, as well as any and all activities that occur under your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account and any other such security breach. We will not be liable for any loss that may occur as a result of someone else using your account or password, with or without your knowledge. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.</p>
<p>We have the right to disable any account at any time in our sole discretion if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use. All information you enter into the Portal is governed by our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>You are solely liable for all the taxes, fees, and commissions resulting from the use of the Portal. These Terms of Use alone do not create a joint venture, partnership, or principal-agent relationship between you and the Company, or any other users, and nothing in these Terms of Use may be used to imply such a relationship. You agree to indemnify the Company from any liability for, or assessment of, any claims or penalties with respect to such taxes, labor, or employment requirements, including any liability for, or assessment of taxes imposed on the Company by the relevant taxing authorities with respect to any fees paid or any other transfer of value to you as the result of using the Portal.</p>
<h2>Assumption of Risk; No Advice</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets are volatile and shift quickly in terms of liquidity, market depth, and trading dynamics. Speculation on any commodity or product, including cryptocurrency, includes risks, which you should evaluate independently. You are solely responsible and liable for your account on the Portal and knowing the true status of your TrustTokens even if the information on the Portal is displayed incorrectly.</p>
<p>The Company does not provide investment advice. The information contained within the Portal is for informational purposes only, and the Company is not soliciting any action based upon such materials. The material is not to be construed as investment advice. We do not provide any consultation on the advisability of purchasing, selling, or transferring TrustTokens, or provide any other information such as trading techniques, models, algorithms, or any other schemes. Additionally, the material accessible through the Portal does not constitute a representation that the use of any TrustTokens are suitable or appropriate for you.</p>
<h2>Risk of Loss</h2>
<p>THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRANSACTING WITH DIGITAL ASSETS CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER TRANSACTING WITH DIGITAL ASSETS IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.</p>
<p>All rewards or other value paid to you as a result of staking TrustTokens are provided by the third-party service providers, decentralized finance lending platforms, or centralized blockchain financial companies that provide independent staking opportunities for TrustToken holders (collectively, “Third-Party Platforms”).</p>
<p>Please note the following risks of loss in using TrustTokens:</p>
<h3>Theft and Loss</h3>
<p>Decentralized finance is a novel and complex market. Fraud, theft, and hacks on Third-Party Platforms are possible. A Third-Party Platform being accessible through the Portal does not constitute a representation that the staking of any TrustTokens on that Third-Party Platform is suitable or appropriate for you, or that the Company is liable for losses that occur on a Third-Party Platform.  Transactions in TrustTokens may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>
<h3>Market Value</h3>
<p>The market value of TrustTokens may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to stake TrustTokens on Third-Party Platforms and is separate from the utility value  of TrustToken. A lack of participants willing to stake TrustTokens on Third-Party Platforms  may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of market value of TrustTokens.</p>
<h3>Liquidation Risk</h3>
<p>TrustTokens may be used as a form of decentralized credit enhancement for Third-Party Platforms that offer certain financial opportunities to their users. By staking TrustTokens on a Third-Party Platform, you may receive rewards generated by the Third-Party Platform in return for such staking activity. If a loss is realized by the users of the Third-Party Platform, your TrustTokens may be liquidated by the TrustToken smart contract causing a permanent and total loss of some or all value to the TrustTokens staked on the Third-Party Platform. You are solely responsible for conducting all due diligence on any Third-Party Platform you chose to stake on and are solely liable for any and all losses that occur as a result of choosing to stake on any Third-Party Platform.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>In the event that you provide us any ideas, thoughts, criticisms, suggested improvements, or other feedback related to Portal (collectively “Feedback”), you agree that we may use the Feedback in any way we deem appropriate to: (a) improve our Portal and (b) promote the Portal, and that you will not be due any compensation for your Feedback that is used in these ways.</p>
